The requirements should just be GitPython and Pygame

If you run main.py it runs a single simulation with visualization (cards are not represented)

If you want to run another simulation, delete the Catan_0 folder or change the sim(0,True) line in main.py to a higher number.
The git repo that saves the actions taken by the simulation are in the Catan_x folder.
